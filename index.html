    <h1>Game Master Guide</h1>
    <p>Follow these steps to guide the game:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start the Meeting Period (Night Phase):</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Everyone closes their eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Web and Graphic Designer:</strong> Open your eyes and recognize each other as linked. If one is fired, the other will also be fired.</li>
        <li><strong>Developer:</strong> Open your eyes and select a person to protect. This person will be immune from being fired. You cannot protect the same person twice in a row.</li>
        <li><strong>Hackers:</strong> Open your eyes and silently point to one person to fire.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitor:</strong> Open your eyes and silently point to one person to fire (independent of the Hackers).</li>
        <li><strong>HR:</strong> Open your eyes and choose to:
          <ul>
            <li>Save a player targeted by the Hackers.</li>
            <li>Fire a player of your choice (use this power only once).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Influencer:</strong> Open your eyes and select a player to automatically receive one vote against them during the day phase.</li>
        <li>Everyone closes their eyes again.</li>
      </ul>

      <li><strong>Move to the Debriefing Period (Day Phase):</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Everyone opens their eyes.</li>
        <li>Announce the results of the night:
          <ul>
            <li>Who was protected by the Developer or HR.</li>
            <li>Who (if anyone) was fired by the Hackers or Competitor.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Generate a random event using the QR code and explain its effect to the players.</li>
        <li>Facilitate a debate where players discuss and try to identify the Hackers or Competitor.</li>
        <li>Host a vote:
          <ul>
            <li>Players vote on who they think should be fired.</li>
            <li>The Manager’s vote counts double. In the event of a tie, the Manager decides who is fired.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reveal the fired player’s role and remove them from the game.</li>
      </ul>

      <li><strong>Repeat the steps until a victory condition is met:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Hackers win if their number equals or exceeds the remaining players.</li>
        <li>The Competitor wins if they eliminate everyone else.</li>
        <li>Employees win if all Hackers and the Competitor are fired.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>Good luck, Game Master! Keep the agency safe!</p>
